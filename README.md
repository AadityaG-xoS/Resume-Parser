# Resume-ParserX

The Resume Parser Project aims to simplify the process of extracting relevant information from resumes using state-of-the-art prompt engineering techniques. Our goal is to provide a tool that can accurately and efficiently parse resumes into structured data, enabling easy integration with HR systems, job boards, and other applications.

# Features
Advanced Prompt Engineering:
Utilizes the latest techniques in prompt engineering to improve the accuracy and efficiency of resume parsing.

Multi-format Support:
Capable of parsing resumes in various formats, including PDF, DOCX, and plain text.

Structured Output: 
Extracts and organizes information into structured JSON format.

Customizable: 
Easily customizable prompts and parsing rules to suit specific needs.
Open Source: 
Completely open source, encouraging community contributions and collaboration.

# Functionality
The parser accepts resumes in multiple formats:
PDF
DOCX
Plain text

The parser produces structured JSON output containing key information such as:
Personal Information (name, contact details)
Work Experience (job titles, companies, durations)
Education (degrees, institutions, years)
Skills (technical skills, soft skills)
Certifications and Achievements

# Workflow
Input Processing: The resume is uploaded or input into the parser.

Prompt Engineering: The parser uses carefully designed prompts to extract relevant information.

Data Extraction: Key information is extracted and organized into a structured format.

Output Generation: The structured data is output in JSON format for easy integration with other systems.

# Implementation Details
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
PDF processing: PyMuPDF, pdfminer.six
DOCX processing: python-docx
Natural Language Processing: spaCy, NLTK
Machine Learning: Transformers (Hugging Face)

Prompt Engineering
We use prompt engineering techniques to improve the accuracy of information extraction. This involves creating and refining prompts that guide the parser to identify and extract relevant details from the resumes.

# Architecture
Input Module: Handles different resume formats and converts them into a processable form.

Parsing Module: Utilizes NLP and prompt engineering to extract structured information.

Output Module: Formats the extracted data into JSON and handles integration with external systems.

Customization
Users can customize the prompts and parsing rules by modifying the configuration files. This allows the parser to be tailored to specific use cases or industries.
